                        <p>My hobby of building and tinkering with computers eventually led me me into web development.  Over the past few years I've vastly expanded my interest and knowledge of web development technologies and tools.  Lately I've been diving deeper and deeper into Javascript as I am consistently unable to find an end to it's usefullness.  As such, I've realized that my oldest web development friends HTML, and CSS may think I've forgotten them.  In an effort to show them that couldn't be further from the truth I've decided to rewrite my portfolio using HTML5, CSS3, and a responsive design  (along with some touch friendly javascript, shhhh).  Check it out along with some examples of my work below.</p>

                        <p>TMP is an advertising agency targeting career recruitment sites.  While working here I've created tools we use internally, products we sell in a packaged template, and a template for a responsive design package.</p>

                        <h3>The Chorus Project</h3>
                        <p>This was a project based in Chapel Hill, NC and funded by a grant from UNC.  This project was fun for me because a lot of friends of mine worked on it (I used to live in there).  The artsy design was a nice change from a lot of the bland things I had been working on at the time.</p>

                        <p>As much as I'd like to say I created this entire site, I actually just did a bit of freelance work on a few of the pages.  This project was really interesting for me as it was my introduction to parallax scrolling and I felt like the design concept worked really well with it.</p>

                        <p>I worked on a complete overhaul of their calorie counter app.  This project was exciting to me because it was my first heavy javascript application, and really launched my current interest in the language.</p>

                        <p>SpotCo is an advertising agency for broadway shows.  It was really fun working here because all the designs were super exaggerated and fantastical.  Not a lot of challenge functionality wise, but it's always nice to work with such different designs.</p>
